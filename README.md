# AI-Songs
This project merges the educational rigor of data science concepts with the creative engagement of music, crafting an innovative learning experience. Utilizing the capabilities of AI through ChatGPT for lyric composition and Suno.com for tunes and music production, I have developed a series of songs that encapsulate fundamental data science principles. The aim is to enhance recall and understanding of complex topics like SHAP Analysis, Cross-Validation, Decision Trees, Linear Regression, and Regularization through the memorability of music. This approach not only makes learning more enjoyable but also leverages the power of auditory learning and mnemonic devices.
